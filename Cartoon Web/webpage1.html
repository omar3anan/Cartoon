 <p >SpongeBob SquarePants is an American animated comedy television series created by marine science educator and animator Stephen Hillenburg for Nickelodeon. The series chronicles the adventures and endeavors of the title character and his aquatic friends in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom. The fifth-longest-running American animated series, its popularity has made it a media franchise. It is the highest rated series to air on Nickelodeon distributed property. The media franchise has generated more than $13 billion in merchandising revenue for Nickelodeon.Many of the series' ideas originated in The Intertidal Zone, an unpublished educational book that Hillenburg created in 1989 to teach his students about undersea life He began developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television series in 1996 following the cancellation of Rocko's Modern Life, and in 1997, a seven-minute pilot was pitched to Nickelodeon. He turned to Tom Kenny, who had worked with him on that series. SpongeBob was originally going to be named SpongeBoy, and the series called SpongeBoy Ahoy!.

</video>Nickelodeon held a preview for the series in the United States on May 1, The series officially premiered on July 17, 1999. It has received worldwide critical acclaim and had gained enormous popularity by its second season.A feature film, The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, was released in theaters on November 19, 2004. A second film adaptation, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water, followed on February 6, 2015. A third film and prequel to the television series, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run, was released in Canadian theaters on August 14, 2020.

SpongeBob SquarePants has won a variety of awards including: six Annie Awards, eight Golden Reel Awards, four Emmy Awards, 17 Kids' Choice Awards, and two BAFTA Children's Awards , Kamp Koral: SpongeBob's Under Years, an untitled project based on the character Squidward Tentacles, and The Patrick Star Show, are in development as of 2020.
The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie was long-planned; Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures had approached series creator Stephen Hillenburg for a film based on the show, but he refused for more than a year.Hillenburg was concerned, after watching The Iron Giant (1999) and Toy Story (1995) with his son, about the challenge of SpongeBob and Patrick doing something more cinematically and inspiring without losing what he calls the SpongeBob "cadence". While on a break from season four post-production, "To do a 75-minute movie about SpongeBob wanting to make some jellyfish jelly would be a mistake, I think this's where the comedy's coming from, having these two naïve characters, SpongeBob and Patrick, a doofus and an idiot, on this incredibly dangerous heroic odyssey with all the odds against them.</p>
